components:
-------------------
There are the main concepts of react js. Every component have their own login and design.
> Types
 >Function Component (stateless component)
 >Class Component (stateful component)

** Function Component- It can not manage state. We can rendor the props values.
** Class Component - We can manage the status and also use props values.


React Props:
---------------------
> Used to send data from parent component to chind components.
> Props are read-only.
> Props are immutable, means not change 

React State:
----------------------
> States are mutable it means we may change the satate as per the need.
> to apply dynamic behavior.

** Note-state are used in class component

--> How we define state
    constructor(props)
    {
        super(props);
        this.state={name:'gsv',city:'Meerut'};
    }
--> How we read the state
    this.state.name
--> How we update the data
    this.setState({name:'gsv'})
